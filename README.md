# Video-Anomaly-Detection
Weakly supervised non-interfering line representation learning network for video anomaly detection

Hello, I will submit my method to ICLR. This method is based on two datasets, SH and UCF. The accuracy exceeds SOTA and it has great advantages in lightweight. It is the first method to maintain high accuracy without using 10-crop. The FLOPs is less than 1G and can be deployed on edge devices. The test speed is also greatly improved. Since my code is related to my next work, it is expected that the code will be open sourced in December.
